 * Overview:
 * {{{
 * An rc5 word is composed of 14 bits:  SSTAAAAACCCCCC
 *   - two start bits (always 1)
 *   - one toggle bit (changes value a key is released and pressed again)
 *   - five address bits
 *   - six command bits
 *
 * The signal we actually decode is this 14-bit-word encoded in inverted manchester code.
 *
 *                          +--             --+
 * a one is encoded as:   __|   , inverted:   |__
 *
 *                        --+                 +--
 * a zero is encoded as:    |__ , inverted: __|
 *
 * which means the data signal (already inverted) for the rc5 word
 * 11000010000001 (address 0x02, command 0x01, toggle bit 0) is:
 *
 * bit          S     S     T     A     A     A     A     A     C     C     C     C     C     C

 * Another example: 11100010000010 (address 0x02, command 0x02, toggle bit 1) is:

 *
 *
 * Observation #1: After 27 halfbits we are done in any case. If the last bit
 *                 is a 0, we get the last pin-change interrupt at halfbit 26,
 *                 this is a special case.  In the timeout handling function
 *                 which is called after the last interrupt, we have to check
 *                 if we received 26 or 27 halfbits.  If only 26 halfbits have
 *                 been received, we have to add a zero to the decoded bit-stream.
 *
 * Observation #2: Within a sequence of two zeroes or two ones, an odd number
 *                 of pin-change interrupts occur, and a sequence of a one and
 *                 a zero (the order doesn't matter), contains an even number
 *                 of interrupts:
 *
 *                 |  1  |  1  |        |  0  |  0  |
 *
 *                 ---+  +--+              +--+  +--      3 pin-chages
 *                    |__|  |__         ___|  |__|
 *
 *
 *                 |  1  |  0  |        |  0  |  1  |
 *                                                        2 pin-changes
 *                 ---+     +---           +-----+
 *                    |_____|           ___|     |___
 *
 *
 *                 Conclusion: Every time the bit-sequence alternates between
 *                 zero and one, the parity on the number of pin-change
 *                 interrupts changes.  We can use this to determine, if the
 *                 last transmitted bit was a one or a zero, by just checking
 *                 the parity of the number of interrupts which occured before
 *                 the current one, every second halfbit (which actually means
 *                 we check after each transmitted bit).
 *
 *                 In the beginning, after the halfbit 1 (actually the second,
 *                 but since the first bit is a one, the signal level isn't
 *                 changed and we don't get an interrupt), we know a one has
 *                 transmitted. Therefore if the parity is even, a change in
 *                 the bit-sequence has happenend and the last bit was a zero,
 *                 if the parity is odd another change (or no change) happened,
 *                 the last bit was a one.
 *
 *                 Examples (from above):
 *
 *
 * bit          S     S     T     A     A     A     A     A     C     C     C     C     C     C
 * value     |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |

 * General Roadmap: 1) Interrupt on the first falling edge, activate and reset a
 *                     timer, reset halfbit-counter and interrupt-counter, switch
 *                     interrupt to fire at any logical change, enable timer
 *                     overflow interrupt.
 *                  2) In external interrupt, check if one or two halfbits have
 *                     passed between this and the last interrupt by checking the
 *                     timer (using RC5_BIT_TICKS/RC5_HALF_TICKS and RC5_ENVIRONMENT),
 *                     process each detected halfbit, increment the
 *                     interrupt-counter afterwards.
 *                  3) In timer overflow interrupt (timeout), check if 26 (add a zero)
 *                     or 27 halfbits have been received, copy output, reconfigure
 *                     interrupt to fire at the falling edge again, disable timer
 *                     overflow interrupt, copy output to global public structure.
